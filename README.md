__Predicting Customer Purchase Behavior in Black Friday Sales__

In todayâ€™s fast-paced retail environment, understanding customer purchase behavior is crucial for businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and improve sales. This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the purchase amounts of customers during Black Friday sales, based on demographic and product-related features.  

The dataset, provided by ABC Private Limited, contains transaction records of customers, including details such as age, gender, occupation, marital status, city category, and product information. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to develop an accurate model that can predict purchase amounts and help businesses create personalized offers and targeted promotions.  

We will experiment with multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to identify the most effective approach. Feature engineering techniques, such as encoding categorical variables and handling missing values, will be applied to improve model performance.  

This Exploratory Data Analysis will provide valuable insights into customer spending habits, enabling retailers to refine their sales strategies and enhance the overall shopping experience.
